# raftik

A tiny WASM runtime - a raft for WebAssembly.

## Vision

Implement only what’s essential, and keep the code so clear you can read it in one evening.

## Status

🚧 **Work in progress** – early implementation. 

Currently, only WebAssembly binary parsing is implemented.
You can run the following command to parse a WASM file and display the result:

```
cargo run <wasm file>
```


## Name

**raftik** (*RAF-tik*) — diminutive of “raft”, reflecting our goal of a tiny craft that keeps your WebAssembly modules afloat.
